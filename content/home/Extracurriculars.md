Besides becoming a researcher I have always been passionate about collectively making a difference. This got me involved in the democratic representation of students at my university. The students council had just been established in 2013, so I joined the efforts in building and shaping it from the beginning of my studies at University Heidelberg. 
Select of my contributions:

  - 11.2014 - 04.2017 Chairman of the students council at the University Heidelberg
  - 08.2014 - 04.2017 member of the senate at the University Heidelberg
  
### Fellowships
I was awarded a scholarship for outstanding academic achievements and social and political involvement given by the "Friedrich-Ebert-Foundation" in 2016.
