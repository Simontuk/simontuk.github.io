#### Department of Biomedical Informatics - Harvard Medical School
*04.2017 to 10.2017*  
With [Peter Kharchenko][1] at the [DBMI](http://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School I worked on the analysis of signaling in single cell transcriptional Data. I used the relations of ligands and receptors in single cell RNA-seq data to infer singaling between cells and the effect of co-expression of ligands and receptors. Additionally I worked on [Pagoda 2](http://github.com/hms-dbmi/pagoda2), a pipeline and interactive tool for the analysis of single cell data.  
#### Genome Biology - EMBL Heidelberg
*11.2016 - 03.2017*  
I was mentored by James Reddington at [Eileen Furlongs][2] Lab at EMBL and I joined him in his project that involved the analysis of priming of enhancers with time-course DNase-hypersensitivity sequencing data of drosophila embryos. 
#### Intelligent Imaging - bioquant Heidelberg
*05.2016 to 10.2016*  
I was supervised by Stephan Tirier at the lab of [Christian Conrad][3] and applied single cell genomics on a cancer cellline and helped linking transcriptional signatures with phenotypical features of cells and microtissues. I used PAGODA and other tools in the scope of single cell genomics.
