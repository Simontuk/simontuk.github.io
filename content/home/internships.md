### Current and former Projects
With [Peter Kharchenko][1] at Harvard Medical School he works on the analysis of signaling ligands and receptor-relationships in single cell RNA-seq data and worked on Pagoda 2, a pipeline for the analysis of single cell data.  
James Reddington at [Eileen Furlong][2] Lab at EMBL mentored him in his project that involved the analysis of priming of enhancers with DNase-hypersensitivity sequencing data of drosophila embryos.  
Supervised by Stephan Tirier at the lab of [Christian Conrad][3] he applied single cell genomics on a cancer cellline and helped linking transcriptional signatures with phenotypical features of cells.
